# Cryptocurrencies payment system
This project implement a smart contract that can receive payment via arbitrary token pre-configured by the owner and release a license to the software that the smart contract is selling. The way it works is simple, in your software (the want that you want to sell online), you call to the seller contract's hasLicense function and provide the keccak256(mac_address) of the current computer, if it returns true, then the user can use the software, otherwise, the users can not use. To buy a license, the user need to call the contract's buy(address tokenAddress, bytes32 macHash) and provide the macHash of her computer (which should be provided by your software). If the user done it right, then she should be able to use the software after that.
